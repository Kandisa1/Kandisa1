## About Me

Hey there! I'm a passionate computer science major student with a knack for programming languages like Java, C/C++, Python, and database management with MySQL. When I'm not buried in code, you can find me indulging in my other passions: watching movies, karate and dancing.

## Projects Highlights

Here are some of the exciting projects I've been working on:

1. **Inventory Management System**: Developed an inventory management software for a small business to track their ingoing and outgoing flow of products and manage invoicing using Java (Netbeans) and php MySQL.
